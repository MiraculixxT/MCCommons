## MC-Commons
All common code for my MC-Projects (plugins and fabric mods). 

Some features are known from **KPaper** (Fork from KSpigot) but separated to use in multiprojects.

### Features
- ``Localization`` - Add translations to your project. The language will be adapted by the player selected language.
- ``Easy Components`` - Create text components, translation components and namespace components with all kinds of formatting.
- ``Useful Serializer`` - Serialize and deserialize common objects like UUID, YAML, MiniMessage.
- ``Useful Extensions`` - Like collections, enums, files and numbers.
